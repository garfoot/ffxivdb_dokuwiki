# ffxivdb_dokuwiki
Dokuwiki plugin for embedding FFXIV Lodestone items in wiki pages

## Installation
Zip this up and import it into your Dokuwiki to use.

## Use
Syntax for the plugin is simple.Just find the item on the Lodestone and make a note of the id of it. That's the number and letter bit at the end of the address in the address bar. E.g. ```http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/1d74b70d57b/``` would be id ```1d74b70d57b```.

Then put in your page ```{{ffitem>idhere,namehere}}``` e.g. ```{{ffitem>1d74b70d57b,Axe of the Blood Emperor}}```.
